- instance variables
- reference variables
- static methods - ind of objects, cannot be overriden but can hide other static methods from the superclass.
                 - In Java, static methods belong to the class, not instances. They are resolved at compile-time based on the reference type.

- instance method - dep on objects, In Java, instance methods are resolved dynamically (runtime polymorphism).
                  - The method call is determined by the actual object's type, not the reference type.
                  - Dynamic method dispatch/invocation
